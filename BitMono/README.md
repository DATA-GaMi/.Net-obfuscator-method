BitMono is a free, open-source C# obfuscator that was initially designed and intended mainly for Mono, however, now you're feel free to use it for any .NET app, but, be careful some protections work on .NET Framework, some on .NET, some on Mono, some on Unity only.

BitMono uses [AsmResolver][asmresolver] instead of [dnlib][dnlib] (which we used in the past) for handling assemblies. If you have questions or issues, please let us know [here][bitmono_issues]. Download the latest version of BitMono [here][bitmono_releases].

You can also use BitMono as an engine to build custom obfuscators. It is built using dependency injection (DI) using [Autofac][autofac_repo] and follows the latest C# best practices.

## Usability

BitMono breaks the most popular tools using just one packer, such as:
- dnSpy;
- dnlib;
- AsmResolver;
- MonoCecil;
- ILSpy;
- PEBear;
- DetectItEasy;
- CFF Explorer
- Perhaps, some dumpers?
- and many, many more...

So, if you will add more protection to the file, I think it would seem like total magic. :D

## Documentation

Read the **[docs][bitmono_docs]** to read protection, functionality, and more.

## How your app will look since BitMono obfuscation - just in a few words
* Looks like C++ application but is an actual C# application;
* Crash of decompilers when analyzing types;
* Broken decompilers;
* Broken IL Code;
* Invisible types;
* No code

## Features

* StringsEncryption
* **[UnmanagedString][unmanagedstring_source]** (based on existing protection)
* **[BitDotNet][bitdotnet_source]** (based and improved on existing protection)
* **[BitMethodDotnet][bitmethoddotnet_source]** (based and improved on existing protection)
* **[DotNetHook][dotnethook_source]** (based on existing protection)
* CallToCalli
* ObjectReturnType
* NoNamespaces
* FullRenamer
* AntiDebugBreakpoints
* AntiDecompiler
* BitDecompiler (fixed version of BitDotNet for newer Unity Versions)
* BitDateTimeStamp
* BitMono
* BillionNops
* AntiDe4dot
* AntiILdasm
* and you can integrate existing/make own feature ;)

## Usage

### Download

To download the latest release of BitMono, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Latest BitMono Release][bitmono_latest_release].
2. Select and download the archive file that matches the Target Framework of the application you want to protect. Here are some examples:

- **Targeting .NET 8**: If your target file is built for .NET 8, download:
  `BitMono-v0.25.3+e64e54d3-CLI-net8.0-win-x64.zip`

- **Targeting .NET Standard**: If your target file is built for .NET Standard, you can use either BitMono for .NET Framework or .NET 8:
  `BitMono-v0.25.3+e64e54d3-CLI-net8.0-win-x64.zip`

- **Targeting .NET Framework**: If your target file is built for .NET Framework, download:
  `BitMono-v0.25.3+e64e54d3-CLI-net462-win-x64.zip`

- **Targeting Mono or Unity Engine Runtime**: If your target file is built for .NET Framework and runs on Mono or Unity, use the .NET Framework version:
  `BitMono-v0.25.3+e64e54d3-CLI-net462-win-x64.zip`

> **Note:** Be sure to select the correct version of BitMono that matches your Target Framework. Using the wrong version could result in compatibility issues.

### Pre-Require

Enable one of the protection in `protections.json` file: Set `Enabled` to `true`.

### Using CLI

`BitMono.CLI <path to file>/drag-and-drop`

Always drop dependencies in `libs` directory in the same path where `file` for obfuscation is located

Your obfuscation directory structure will look something like this:
```
specially_created_folder_for_obfuscation/
├─ your_app.exe
└─ libs/
  ├─ ImportantLibrary.dll
  ├─ SuperImportantLibrary.dll
  └─ ...
```

Copy all libraries (.dll) from the building application folder and paste them into the `libs` directory (if it doesn't exist yet create it), or even create the libs directory yourself with a custom name for example - `myLibs`, and then specify it in BitMono, however, if you will use `libs` then by default BitMono looking for a `libs` directory, so it will save your time.

### Using CLI Commands

```console
  -f, --file         Required. Set file path.

  -l, --libraries    Set libraries path.

  -o, --output       Set output path.

  --help             Display this help screen.

  --version          Display version information.
```

Basic example
```console
$ BitMono.CLI -f C:\specially_created_folder_for_obfuscation/your_app.exe -l specially_created_folder_for_obfuscation/libs
```

In case when you already have a directory with the name `libs` (specially_created_folder_for_obfuscation\libs) BitMono will catch it automatically, so, you don't need to specify it anymore, but you can in case if you made another directory with `libs` somewhere on the disk or even just for "visibility".
```console
$ BitMono.CLI -f C:\specially_created_folder_for_obfuscation/your_app.exe
```

Specify custom `libs` directory
```console
$ BitMono.CLI -f C:\specially_created_folder_for_obfuscation/your_app.exe -l C:\mythings\obfuscation\superLibsDirectory
```

Specify file, libs and output. If output directory doesn't exist BitMono will create it automatically and even open it on the top of the screen, if you want you can disable opening of the directory on the of top of the screen in `obfuscation.json` - and set `OpenFileDestinationInFileExplorer` to false.
```console
$ BitMono.CLI -f C:\specially_created_folder_for_obfuscation/your_app.exe -l C:\mythings\obfuscation\superLibsDirectory -o C:\specially_created_folder_for_obfuscation/output
```

### Building

If you want to build the BitMono by your own - [click here for detailed info][build_info]

### Supported Frameworks

Feel free to use BitMono on frameworks which described below. Be careful using some protections because some might work on .NET Framework only, some on .NET (Core) only, some on all frameworks, some on Mono only - if the protection is unique to its platform/framework you will get a notification about that.

| Framework      | Version |
|----------------|---------|
| .NET           | 9.0     |
| .NET           | 8.0     |
| .NET           | 7.0     |
| .NET           | 6.0     |
| .NET Framework | 462     |
| netstandard    | 2.0     |
| netstandard    | 2.1     |
