Intended for ... runtime
========================

`Intended for Mono runtime` and `Intended for .NET Core runtime` are normal messages, but normal if you know what you're doing.

`BitDecompiler` - `Intended for Mono runtime` - means the protection is only working on Mono runtime, in this case this protection only work with Mono because it uses a bugs of Mono to hide some stuff in decompilers, however if you run that app in default .NET it won't work.
