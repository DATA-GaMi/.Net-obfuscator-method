===============

How it works?
-------------

Protection adds invalid IL code in the file, as the result in the old dnSpy version it's going to be harder to see the C# code of the method body.

Protection Type
---------------

The protection type is `Protection`.


.. warning::

    This protection compatible only with Mono, but, as far as is known this protection can be used in old versions of .NET Framework, but literally not with .NET Core, etc.
