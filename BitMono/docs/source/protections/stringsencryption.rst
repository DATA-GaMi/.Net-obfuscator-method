How it works?
-------------

Protection encrypts strings using basic AES encryption, but not everyone like it because it makes the worse performance of application, but can be used with AntiDecompiler to crash dnSpy while analyzing the used class, also makes the RVA of the byte[] 0

---------------

The protection type is `Protection`.
